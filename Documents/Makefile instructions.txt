					*******HAS TO BE RAN ON A LINUX SYSTEM*******
This is the guide for making a makefile on Linux, mainly for C++ programs.
Part 1 This is for non-boost based programs:
1. The makefile must be named makefile or MakeFile preferable to be uniform with us the first one.
2. Then know the name of the object, which is the name of the program.
3. Their are three parts of this the .o file the .cpp then the clean up part incase something goes wrong.
4. the syntax for this is the following for the file name project.cpp:

project: project.o
	g++ -o project project.o
project.o: project.cpp
	g++ -c project.cpp
clean:
	rm -r *.o project
	
5. All of this should be ran as a super user. 
Will be making a guide for the boost system makefile if testing goes good for it.
